# Quiz Program - JAVA

---
The project is a Java-based quiz program that allows users to create and participate in quizzes. The program offers two main options to users - adding questions or starting the quiz.

If the user selects the "Add Quiz" option, they can create a question along with multiple choices and set the correct answer. The quiz set is saved into a JSON file using the Gson Java library, which makes it easy to read and manipulate the data.

If the user selects the "Start Quiz" option, the quiz will appear, showing a question and multiple choices. The user must select the correct answer from the options provided. Once the quiz is complete, the system will show the total score.
